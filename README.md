Lombok ExtensionMethod examples

This code is used in the article on my blog: http://nawaman.net/blog/2017-11-16.

The code shows example of how to use Lombok @ExtensionMethod.

The code is an Eclipse project. You should be able to import this into your Eclipse workspace with Lombok installed. The code can also be built with gradle so you can clone the code manually and run gradle build.

Let me know if there is any questions.
